# nodeFargateTest
small node container which shows environment varaibles

Used for testing injecting secrets into a container with AWS Fargate.  Secrets get pulled in from AWS Secrets Manager as environment variables.  I was looking at testing basic functionality of that and wanted to make sure the test secret was getting pulled in.
